If that’s you, another option you have is to make and sell your products to people. With doing this, you have much more control over your daily tasks and how many different kinds of things you’re selling. This week, the topic we’ll be focusing on is: What jobs teens can start today, products edition. As I explained in my last episode, it’s important for teens to not only learn about money, but to make some of their own! The topic becomes much more relevant when you’re figuring out what to do with your hard earned money. I talked about services that wouldn’t require anyone else to hire you, so you could start working no matter your age. This episode I’ll go over 6 different things you can make and sell to people. I’ll talk about the pros and cons of each, and where you can sell these items. So if you love creating things or prefer making money this way, keep listening!<br/><br/>If you liked this episode please subscribe, leave a review, and share this podcast, so this content can help as many people as possible.<br/><br/><a href='https://bmc.xyz/l/KNDeE'>Print out my outline &amp; discussion guide.</a><br/><br/><a href='https://www.buymeacoffee.com/talialevy'>Buy me a coffee &amp; support this podcast.</a><br/><br/>Are you a visual learner? <a href='https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCxNEEkU5PXglK-YVxfm-8cA'>Subscribe to my YouTube channel and watch the animated versions of my episodes.</a><br/><br/><b>Money Moves Favorites:<br/></b>-<b> </b><a href='http://canva.7eqqol.net/mmft'>Canva</a><br/>- <a href='https://amzn.to/2HqkPEN'>The Non-Designer&apos;s Design Book<br/></a>- <a href='https://amzn.to/3dTlmL8'>My Bullet Journal</a><br/><br/><em>FTC Disclaimer: This section contains affiliate links, which means I may receive a small commission, at no extra cost to you, if you make a purchase through the link!<br/><br/></em>Check out my <a href='https://moneymovesforteens.com/'>website.</a><br/>Talk to me on <a href='https://twitter.com/moneymoves14s'>Twitter.</a><br/>The face behind the voice <a href='https://www.instagram.com/talia.simone_/'>(my Instagram).</a><br/><br/>See you next week!</p>]]></description>
