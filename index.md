podcast-description: "If you are a teenager, I want to let you know that now is the time to start saving for retirement. I know it sounds weird, but there is one main reason why doing so is a good idea, and that reason is time. You are still young, which means your money has more time to grow. This episode, I’m going to talk all about 401(k) and 403(b) retirement accounts."

youtube-description: "How many of you have a great idea for a product or service, but you just don’t know how to tell people about it? Do you go to your parents, your friends, your teachers?

This episode, I’m going to talk about 6 ways you can advertise your business to others."
