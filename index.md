podcast-description: "Have you ever wondered what habits millionaires have picked up, that led them to the spot they’re at today? This week, I’m going to cover 6 traits millionaires have in common, and I’ll explain why these people may be implementing these points into their routine, and how you might possibly do the same."

youtube-description: "As teenagers, we’ve grown up hearing from adults to do well in school, be accepted into a good college to get a degree, then go work and and make money through your salary to support yourself and your family; and hopefully as you age, that salary will increase. But, they don’t always mention that there different types of “work” you can do to make money. This episode, I’m focusing on active income and I’ll talk about what it is, give some examples, and explain the pros and cons."
