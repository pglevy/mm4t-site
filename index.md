podcast-description: "If you’re a teenager listening to this episode, I want to let you know that now is the time to start saving for retirement. I know it sounds crazy, but there is one main reason why doing so is a good idea, and that reason is time. You are still young, which means your money has more time to grow. This episode, I’m going to talk all about Traditional IRA and Roth IRA retirement accounts."

youtube-description: "Spending money can be really fun, especially when it’s money you know you’ve worked for and have been waiting for the moment to spend it on what you want! But, once you make your purchase, sometimes, there’s guilt that comes after. Should I have saved that money instead? Or given it to an organization that needed it more than me? Or maybe you get money and after a week, you have no idea where it went! You’ve spent it all, but you forgot what on. A way to take control of your saving and spending, while creating mental freedom when it comes to your finances, is to start budgeting. This episode, I’m going to talk about what budgeting is, and 7 ways budgeting can help you with your money."
