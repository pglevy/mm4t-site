If you’re a teenager listening to this episode, I want to let you know that now is the time to start saving for retirement. I know it sounds crazy, but there is one *main* reason why doing so is a good idea, and that reason is time. You are still young, which means your money has more *time* to grow. This episode, I’m going to talk all about Traditional IRA and Roth IRA retirement accounts.
