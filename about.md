# About me

![Illustration of Talia by her brother, Herschel]({{site.baseurl}}/assets/img/about-photo.jpg){: .w-50 .float-left .mr-4}

I started this podcast because I noticed that while we learn the usual math, science, and language in school, personal finance isn't talked about much. Other subjects relating to business and entrepreneurship aren’t talked about either. I also noticed that my friends don't talk about money other than to say they pretty much spend all of it whenever they have some.

From a young age, my parents taught me the basics of giving, saving, and spending, and overall how to be smart with money. I realize not every parent has time to talk to their kids about this, or knows where to start. I hope this podcast helps spark conversation.

When I'm not working on this podcast, I enjoy making music with my mom and playing softball. These two things have been a part of my life for a while now, and I appreciate both. I started tutoring math at age 11 — my first real job and money-maker. Recently, I started tutoring online, so if you need help with middle school math, check out [Talia’s Tutoring](https://taliastutoring.com/){: .text-primary-lighter}!

​I truly believe personal finance is important and should be talked about with teens now, because it will give them a head start with money.
