  "description": "Hello, and welcome to Money Moves for Teens by Talia! I’m Talia, and I created this podcast because I think kids my age don’t get a good enough education on how to manage money. This is something we should be learning and talking about now so we’ll be better prepared for the future.In this podcast, I’ll cover topics relating to personal finance, including saving, spending, and yes, making money. My hope is that by sharing this information, you will learn about it with me, and my podcast can act as an introduction/head start for you, as you start on your financial journey. I do all the research so you don't have to!This podcast is for all teens who want to get good with money, or for their parents who want to have constructive conversations with their teens about it. Either way, I’m glad you found Money Moves for Teens by Talia, and I hope you enjoy!",
